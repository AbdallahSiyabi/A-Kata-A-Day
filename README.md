# A-Kata-A-Day

As a part of my learning Javascript journey I have taken a challenge to solve 1 Kata everyday from CodeWars. I will be storing the 
problems I solve here and I aim to continue this routine for next 180 days.

1. Parity Outlier 
2. Printer Error
3. Exes and Ohs
4. Collatz Conjecture Length
5. Find smallest integer in the given array
6. Insert Dashes

I also post my approach on solving the Kata everyday on my blog: http://a-kata-a-day.blogspot.in/
